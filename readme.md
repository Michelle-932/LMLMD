## No more uncomfortable dates!

Watching a rom-com and seeing the familiar montage of awful dates, I wanted to build an app to solve some of the problems I remember having when trying to meet new people -- but with your dog! 

- <strong>Planning Dates:</strong> It's hard to find dog-friendly places to go, so you can meet your match and plan your date with this app!
- <strong>Safety:</strong> Dog-friendly places are well lit, full of other people and open during business hours
- <strong>Awkwardness:</strong> Solves the problem of having nothing to talk about. At least you know you both like dogs!
- <strong>Familiarity:</strong> Your dog is an excellent judge of character and can help you feel better in unfamiliar situations

## Key Features

* <strong>Gender Matching Logic:</strong> The app provides users with a comprehensive filtering mechanism that matches individuals based on gender identities and preferences. Using a complex backend filtering logic, users can find potential matches who align with their gender identity and preferences for 'men', 'women', and 'non-binary' individuals.

* <strong>Dog-friendly Date Planning:</strong> Taking user interactions into the real world, Love Me, Love My Dog offers a unique feature that enables users to discover local dog-friendly places suitable for dates. <p>Leveraging MongoDB as the backend database, users can save their favorite venues, explore new suggestions, and even contribute by submitting new dog-friendly places. This feature enhances the app's utility beyond matchmaking and fosters meaningful, dog-centric connections.</p>

* <strong>Tailored for Dog Lovers:</strong> This application introduces a fresh and creative approach to dating, catering specifically to dog lovers. The inclusion of dog-friendly date ideas resonates with those who are passionate about dogs, allowing them to connect with like-minded individuals while sharing memorable experiences with their furry best friends.
